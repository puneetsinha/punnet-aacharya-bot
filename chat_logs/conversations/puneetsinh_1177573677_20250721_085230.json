      "content": "Namaste, Divya. Beta, main samajh sakta hoon. \"Paisa nahi tikta\" - this is a very common concern in today's world. Chinta mat karo. Your Janam Kundali holds the key to understanding why this is happening and what we can do about it.\n\nFrom what I see, Saturn is in your second house of savings. Shani dev ka prabhav hai vahan. Saturn in that position can sometimes create obstacles and delays in accumulating wealth. He teaches us patience and the value of hard-earned money.\n\nAlso, you are currently going through Venus dasha. Venus is in your 7th house. While Venus is generally auspicious, its placement and aspects can influence how you handle your finances.\n\nFurthermore, your Moon and Mars are together in the 11th house, which indicates strong desires and earning potential. However, Mars can sometimes lead to impulsive decisions.\n\nTell me, Divya, are you prone to impulsive spending? Do you find it difficult to stick to a budget? The more details you share, the better I can guide you towards specific remedies and solutions to make your finances more stable. Kuchh upay hain, lekin pehle thoda aur jaan lena hoga. Don't worry, we will find a way together.\n",
