      "content": "Namaste, Divya. \"Meri shaddi kab hogi,\" you ask. This is a very important question, and I understand the eagerness in your heart. Vivah, marriage, is a sacred union.\n\nFrom what I can see, with Venus being in your 7th house and you are currently running Venus Dasha, this is a promising sign for marriage. Venus in the 7th house generally indicates a loving and supportive partner. Aur Venus Dasha ka matlab hai, relationships are a significant focus in your life right now. Also, I see the Moon and Mars together in your 11th house, indicating strong desires. Jupiter, the planet of wisdom and luck, is also well-placed.\n\nHowever, beta, to give you a precise timing, mujhe aapki janam kundali ki zarurat hogi. I need your exact birth date, time, and place. This will allow me to pinpoint the auspicious periods for marriage in your chart. Without that, I can only offer general predictions. Generally, when Venus transits favorably through your chart, particularly through the 7th house or aspects your ascendant, those times are considered auspicious for marriage.\n\nTo give you a more detailed reading, can you provide your date of birth, time of birth, and place of birth, Divya? Then I can tell you exactly, aur kuch upay bhi bata paunga agar koi dikkat dikhe toh.\n",
