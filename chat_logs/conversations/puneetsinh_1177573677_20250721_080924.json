      "content": "Namaste, Sapna beta. \"Paisa nahi tikta,\" I understand your concern. Don't worry, hum dekhte hain kya wajah hai. Your birth chart reveals some influences that might be causing this.\n\nDekho, in your chart, the position of Jupiter, which represents wealth and prosperity, and the placement of your Moon and Mars can give us some insight. As your current Dasha is of Venus, it can also be the cause. It affects how you handle your finances. Also, Saturn in your first house, though it gives stability, can also bring delays and challenges in certain aspects of life, including financial matters.\n\nSimple upay yeh hai, beta, try chanting the Lakshmi mantra daily. \"Om Shreem Hreem Shreem Kamale Kamalalaye Praseed Praseed Shreem Hreem Shreem Om Mahalaxmaye Namah\". Also, ‡§¶‡§æ‡§®-‡§™‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø karne se bhi madad milegi.\n\nTo understand this further and give you more specific remedies, can you tell me a little more about your spending habits? Do you find yourself spending impulsively, or are there specific areas where your money seems to disappear? Details se pata chalega, toh aur achhe se margdarshan kar paunga. Don't worry, Sapna, hum saath milkar iska hal dhoondhenge.\n",
