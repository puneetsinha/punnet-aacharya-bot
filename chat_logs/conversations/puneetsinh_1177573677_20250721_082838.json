      "content": "Namaste, Divya. *Beta*, I understand your concern. \"Paisa nahi tikta, kya karun?\" This is a common worry, and we'll look into what your stars say.\n\nFrom your chart, *mujhe dikhta hai ki*, Saturn is in your second house, the house of wealth, *aur Saturn ki vajah se kabhi kabhi rukavat aati hai*. It can create some restrictions and delays in accumulating wealth. *Lekin chinta mat karo*.\n\nAlso, your Moon and Mars are together in your 11th house. This can give you a good income, *par kabhi kabhi kharche bhi bahut hote hain*. Think about it ‚Äì high earnings, high spending? *Aisa hota hai kya?*\n\nAnd currently, you are running the Dasha of Venus. Venus *bhautik sukh* (material comforts) and pleasures *ka grah hai*. So, naturally, your inclination might be towards enjoying life, which can sometimes lead to increased spending.\n\nTell me, Divya, where do you feel most of your money goes? *Kahan zyada kharcha hota hai tumhara?* Once I understand your spending habits a little better, I can guide you with some practical remedies and *upayas* to help you manage your finances more effectively. Don't worry, *hum milke iska hal nikalenge.* Blessings!\n",
